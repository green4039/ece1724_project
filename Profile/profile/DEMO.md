# FinTrack 3-Minute Demo Script

## Opening (15 seconds)
"Hello everyone! Today I'm excited to demonstrate FinTrack, our Rust-based personal finance management tool. FinTrack features a clean text user interface and helps users track their spending, manage budgets, and monitor their financial goals. Let me show you how it works."

## Authentication Flow (30 seconds)
"First, let's register as a new user. On our cover page, we see our FinTrack logo and two options. I'll press '1' to access the signup page.

For registration, I'll enter:
- Username: 'FinTrack'
- Email: 'fintrack@example.com'
- Password: 'demo123'
- And confirm the password

Notice how our interface masks passwords for security and provides immediate feedback on successful registration.

Now let's log in with our new credentials. Back at the cover page, I'll press '2' for login and enter our email and password... Perfect! We're now at our homepage which provides an overview of our accounts and categories."

## Account Management (45 seconds)
"Let's set up our financial accounts. From the homepage, I'll press '1' to access account management.

First, I'll press 'n' to create a new credit card account:
- Name: 'TD Visa'
- Type: 'credit'

And let's add another account for our checking:
- Name: 'TD Checking'
- Type: 'debit'

Notice how our accounts appear in the list with clear labels. We can navigate between accounts using arrow keys, and if needed, we can delete an account using the 'd' key. The interface constantly shows navigation help at the bottom."

## Category & Budget Setup (45 seconds)
"Now let's set up some spending categories. I'll press '2' from the homepage to access category management.

Let's create three categories:
1. First category:

   - Frequency: 'monthly'

2. Second category:
   - Name: 'restaurants'
   - Type: 'expense'
   - Budget: '200'
   - Frequency: 'monthly'

3. Third category:
   - Name: 'salary'
   - Type: 'income'
   - Budget: '4000'
   - Frequency: 'monthly'

Let me demonstrate how to modify categories. I'll update the restaurants budget:
- Press 'u' to update
- Change budget to '250'
- Change frequency to 'monthly'

And now I'll delete a test category:
- Create a test category named 'To Delete'
- Use arrow keys to select it
- Press 'd' to delete it
- Notice the immediate update in our category list"
