The transcription of our video demo (presented by Ellen!) can be found [here](https://github.com/FinTrak-Solutions/.github/blob/main/profile/DEMO.md).

# Motivation
In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, financial management is crucial for individuals seeking to maintain control over their income and expenses. Although there are various finance related apis and accounting tools available in existing Rust crates, there lacks a centralized tool for users to organize the information, track their spending habits, as well as analyzing their personal expenses. To address this gap, we proposed developing a robust, user-friendly personal finance tracker FIRE using Rust, tailored for users looking for a simplified yet powerful tool to handle their financial management effectively.

# Objectives
We aim to deliver a versatile text user interface(TUI) solution designed to empower users with seamless tracking of income and expenses across customizable categories, while managing multiple account types upon usersâ€™ needs. The tool ensures accurate financial data logging and delivers a smooth experience for users seeking insights into their spending, saving, and investment behavior. Featuring an intuitive, no-frills interface, this utility enables users to optimize their financial strategies and decision-making, to reach long-term financial goals and, eventually, achieve FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early).

Based on our aim, we have two key objectives in this project:

**:moneybag:Intuitive Budgeting Tools:moneybag:**

Users can access easy-to-use text user interfaces to set spending limits in categories like housing, utilities, and entertainment, as well as income expectations, such as salary or bonuses. By allowing budgets to be managed daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly, the tool lets users adjust tracking to fit their personal needs. With real-time updates on spending, users can continuously monitor their progress and stay aligned with their financial goals.

**:ledger:Detailed Financial Reports:ledger:**

Users can access detailed reports that provide clear insights into their spending and saving habits. These reports are available in a category centric way with classified transactions. Additionally, the tool offers budget status summaries (below target, on target, or exceeded) to show users how well theyâ€™re meeting their financial goals.

# Features
In this section, we would explain the details about the features of our personal finance tracker to support the above objectives. Regarding how each feature can be achieved in the app, please check our demo [video](#Video-Demo) and our user [guide](#User-Guide).

## User Authentication
The tool supports user authentication for access control and account interactions. Specifically:
* When the user uses the tool for the first time, he/she would be prompted to enter a username and a password.
* Usernames must be unique. The tool would provide error messages in case of a collision in usernames.
* On subsequent tool usage, the tool would authenticate the user through the username and password.

## Account Management
There are two types of functionalities relevant to account management:
* The tool allows users to add, delete, and rename different accounts.
   * The account names should be unique for the same user. The tool would provide error messages in case of a collision in names when adding or renaming accounts.
* The tool supports multiple types of accounts for each user. The types are defined in two levels:
  1. On the basic level, the accounts are divided into debit and credit accounts.
  2. On the finer-grind level, the user could customize the account names based on their own needs.

## Budget Management
The tool allows users to set and manage budgets through **categories**. We allow categories to be managed by users, which means the users could:
* Create/delete/update categories of different types, names, and budgets.
* Get transactions in different categories.

Specifically, when it comes to budgets, the users are able to:
* Set budget limits for expense categories.
* Set frequency for budgets: daily/weekly/monthly/yearly.

## Transaction Management
The tool supports users to log their transactions and categorize them. More specifically:
* The user can classify a transaction with a category
* Optionally, the user can specify notes with each transaction.
* The user can select and delete a transaction
For each logged transaction, the tool would provide a transaction_id to the user.

## Analysis and Reporting
The tool provides an overview for accounts and categories and a detailed budget checking view that is category centric. Specifically:
* The user can view the account and category balance from the homepage.
* The user can view the budget status for a category and the transactions associated with that budget calculation in a detailed view.

# Reproducibility Guide
## Prerequisites
In order to use our financial tracker, we assume the following libraries are available in the environment:
1. PostgresSQL 17 (Downloading and installation available at [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/))

During the setup, please do not change the username and keep the main password you set.
The rest of this guide assumes the default database username `postgres` with password `123456`.

2. Create a database with Postgres for our financial tracker.

    1. Use `psql -U postgres` to enter PostgresSQL Prompt.
    2. Within the prompt, run the following command: `CREATE DATABASE financial_tracker_db;`
    3. Verify the new database is successfully created by `\l` in the PostgresSQL Prompt
    4. Quit the PostgresSQL Prompt with `\q`

3. Diesel CLI tool (Downloading and installation guide available at [here](https://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started))

For MacOS users:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/releases/latest/download/diesel_cli-installer.sh | sh
```
For Windows users:
```
powershell -c "irm https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/releases/latest/download/diesel_cli-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

## Setting up Backend Server
1. Sync our backend repository at: https://github.com/FinTrak-Solutions/Backend.git
2. Inside Backend/backend, create a file named `.env`, with the following:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:123456@localhost/financial_tracker_db
```
3. Modify the `Backend/backend/diesel.toml`: please replace the `dir` in migrations_directory on line 8 with your own local git repository.
4. Inside Backend/backend, run `diesel migration run`. You should see the migrations within backend/backend/migrations run in sequence.
5. Inside Backend/backend, run `cargo clean`. (Note: this step is necessary for this known [issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70313347/ld-library-not-found-for-lpq-when-build-rust-in-macos) with Diesel)
6. Inside Backend/backend, run `cargo run`.

Your local fintrack server should be ready and running!

## Setting up the TUI Client
1. Sync our frontend repository at: https://github.com/FinTrak-Solutions/TUI.git
2. Inside TUI/frontend, run `cargo clean`.
3. Inside TUI/frontend, run `cargo run`.

# User Guide
To help users better navigate through our tool, we would introduce how to explore our tools in this section.

## Authentication
The authentication tab provides login and signup functions.
### Signup
1. The user could fill in Username, Email, Password, and Confirm Password.
2. Press **Tab** to navigate between input fields.
3. Press **Enter** to submit the form.
4. If passwords don't match, an error message appears.
### Login
Similar to signup page:
1. The user fills in Email and Password.
2. Press **Tab** to navigate between input fields.
3. Press **Enter** to submit the form.
4. If the email/password is incorrect, an error message appears.

## Homepage
The homepage serves as the navigation hub and an overview, as shown in the screenshot below:
![Fintrack Homepage: 3 panels for display, 4 actions for users to try.](./fintrack_homepage.png)
It provides 4 actions as entry points to different user flows:
* Account Management (Press '1')
* Category Management (Press '2')
* Report Reviews (Press '3')
* Add New Transactions (Press 'n')
The user could follow instructions at the bottom of the page to navigate through different functions of our financial tracker.

## Account Management Tab
The tool provides a dedicated workflow for managing accounts. As the demo shows, the user would be able to add/delete accounts of different types through an intuitive interface. Any updates to the account page are refreshed in real-time.
### To add a new account:
 1. Hit key 'n'
 2. Enter account name and type (debit/credit)
 3. Submit using 'Enter'
### To delete an existing account:
1. Use 'â†‘â†“'(Up/Down key) to select the account that you want to delete
2. Hit key 'd' for deleting

## Category and Budget Management Tab
The tool provides a dedicated workflow for managing categories and the corresponding budgets. As the demo shows, the user would be able to add/delete/update different categories for expense and setting budgets for different categories.
### To add a new category:
 1. Hit key 'n'
 2. Enter category nickname, type, budget, and the budget frequency (You can use 'tab' to switch between the text entry boxes).
 3. Submit using 'Enter'
### To delete an existing category:
1. Use 'â†‘â†“'(Up/Down key) to select the category that you want to delete
2. Hit key 'd' for deleting
### To update an existing category:
1. Use 'â†‘â†“'(Up/Down key) to select the account that you want to update
2. Hit key 'u' for updating
3. On the redirect page, enter the desired category details
4. Submit changes using 'Enter'

## Report Tab
The report's detailed view could be accessed from the homepage. It focuses on the budgeting status of the user, and is category centric.

For each category, a preliminary budget analysis on the spending based on user specified frequency is done and the report is color-coded accordingly for better visual experience. The transactions are grouped by categories and ordered by time. Notes of each transaction are also provided.

### To delete an transaction:
Should the user want to **delete** a transaction after checking its details, this is the place. To pin the transaction that the user wants to delete:
![In this screenshot, the transaction to be deleted would be the transaction ID#5](./fintrack_report.png)

1. Use the 'tab' key to switch to the category that the transaction is in. The selected category block would be highlighted in yellow, as shown in category 'food' in the screenshot.
2. Use 'â†‘â†“'(Up/Down key) to select the transaction you want to delete within the category. The selected transaction entry would be highlighted in yellow, as shown in transaction #5 the screenshot.
3. Press key 'd' to delete the selected transaction.

The deletion would be effective immediately and the report tab is refreshed in real-time.

Note: because of the time constraint in this project, we did not have the time to implement the update transaction feature yet. The temporary workaround would be to delete the old transaction and add a new transaction with the adjustments. We acknowledge the inconvenience in this flow, and it is in our backlog to finish this feature.

# Individual Contribution
We divided our work into four different categories: database setup, TUI client development, backend server development, and final report. Note that the final report is not the only documentation we maintain, rather the backend API and frontend user guides were updated accordingly as we developed our project.

# Lessons Learned and Conclusion
It was both a great learning experience as well as a fun journey for us to develop this Rust based financial tracker. We built our knowledge in the Rust full stack world: from the Rocket backend server to the Ratatui frontend client, from Diesel interface of database to how to keep track of our documentation while working in parallel. We hope you enjoy fiddling with our financial tracker, and it would help you manage your financial situation in a clear and friendly way.

Before we close this report and bid you farewell, we would like to add a few lessons learned in our project, and hopefully they would be beneficial to any future readers:

**Establish Clear Milestones**
One of the feedbacks that we received for our proposals was the lack of details in work distribution. We had since restructured our milestones to be more detailed, broken down the bigger goals into smaller components, and assigned clear team members to work on the items. Clear milestones helped us track and measure our progress, estimate the remaining wordload, and adjust our schedules accordingly.

**Regular Status Sync Meetings**
We held status sync meetings regularly throughout the term, with the frequencies adjusted based on due dates. These meetings help us keep our project on track, as discussion and collaboration is unavoidable for a project like this. For example, we have status sync meetings to review and settle the database schemas, to confirm environment setups, and to go over the development status and action items required for either frontend or backend. These meetings help us align our understandings and our role in implementing the features we wanted.

**Keep Documentations Up-to-Date**
It is challenging to work on a coding project in parallel, while different parts our system depend on each other (e.g. frontend needs to communicate with the backend somehow, and the request and response formats need to be in-sync to perform any useful testing and verification on the functionalities). Since we could not have status sync meetings every day, we found it very beneficial to keep documentations on both TUI end and Rocket server end with each incremental commit. The documented APIs facilitated the flexible communication among team members while catching any out-of-sync behaviours in a timely manner.
